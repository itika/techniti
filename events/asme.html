Introduction:</b><br> 
Energy has always been a vital resource in the development of any nation. A finite planet cannot support infinitely increasing consumption of resources and hence the motto of present times must be to “REDUCE, REUSE and RECYCLE”. <br><br>
<b>Event Description: </b><br><br>
The event has been conceptualised with an intention to spread awareness and create interest among students and potential young entrepreneur, towards the concept of sustainability, urging them to take lead roles in curbing Energy Crisis. It is about sharing and discussing ideas intended to reduce the consumption of energy which can be achieved through efficient energy use. The participants will come up with their innovative ideas which may be implemented or marketed upon, thereby directly or indirectly facilitating the growth of the humanity in general and our country in particular. The thrust of the event will be its focus on analysing and understanding energy utilisation and identify areas where energy use can be reduced, decide on how to budget energy use, plan and practice feasible energy conservation method that will enhance energy efficiency, minimize energy wastage and reduce energy costs. <br><br>
<b>Prototype Model Design: </b><br><br>
The participants are required to think of an idea and design a prototype model implementing the idea; that can act as a sustainable source of energy or lower the consumption of natural resources i.e. to make the existing process efficient. Ideas for models can be taken from previous ASME SDC's like device to convert rain energy into kinetic energy, use of gasifiers etc.

Introduction:<br><br>
Recycling is a global industry accounting for more than 1.5 million jobs and $100 billion in annual revenue. As a whole, the industry currently processes more than 600 million metric tons of material annually, growing with the expansion of the global, green economy. This global expansion presents an increased need for new, efficient and cost‐effective waste material sorters. The goal of the 2010 ASME Student Design Competition is to design, build, and test an autonomous system capable of accurately sorting common recyclable materials, namely ferrous and non‐ferrous metals, plastics and glass into distinct waste containers. <br><br>
Event Description: <br><br>
Your job is to design, build, and test a system capable of rapidly and accurately sorting the four waste materials noted above into distinct waste containers. This system must operate autonomously and be capable of both material identification and waste handling. Points will be awarded based on the proper identification and handling of the waste materials, as well as the speed required to process the materials and the weight of the device.
