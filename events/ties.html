				<p>Since ages, humans are successful in tackling the problem of transforming motions. See how in a sewing machine just rotating a wheel makes the sewing needle oscillate, it&acute;s because therE&acute;s an idea of connecting things way cunningly to get such transformation of motion.<br><br>
Now coming to the event, you will be given a problem statement and set of pieces. Now it&acute;s up to you to connect particular pieces from the given set to obtain the complete linkage. The final linkage must satisfy problem statements. The problem statement may be like rotating a particular piece should give rise to an oscillating movement of a certain other piece. In short, you have to solve a puzzle .All u need is imagining an idea of connecting objects to move in a particular relative way. So get ready this time for a true test.<br><br>
This will be having 2 rounds. The details will be provided ASAP. <br><br>
